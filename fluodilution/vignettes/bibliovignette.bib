abstract = {The magnitude of an adaptive immune response is controlled by the interplay of lymphocyte quiescence, proliferation, and apoptosis. How lymphocytes integrate receptor-mediated signals influencing these cell fates is a fundamental question for understanding this complex system. We examined how lymphocytes interleave times to divide and die to develop a mathematical model of lymphocyte growth regulation. This model provides a powerful method for fitting and analyzing fluorescent division tracking data and reveals how summing receptor-mediated kinetic changes can modify the immune response progressively from rapid tolerance induction to strong immunity. An important consequence of our results is that intrinsic variability in otherwise identical cells, usually dismissed as noise, may have evolved to be an essential feature of immune regulation.},

abstract = {Many bacterial pathogens cause persistent infections despite repeated antibiotic exposure. Bacterial persisters are antibiotic-tolerant cells, but little is known about their growth status and the signals and pathways leading to their formation in infected tissues. We used fluorescent single-cell analysis to identify Salmonella persisters during infection. These were part of a nonreplicating population formed immediately after uptake by macrophages and were induced by vacuolar acidification and nutritional deprivation, conditions that also induce Salmonella virulence gene expression. The majority of 14 toxin-antitoxin modules contributed to intracellular persister formation. Some persisters resumed intracellular growth after phagocytosis by na{\"{\i}}ve macrophages. Thus, the vacuolar environment induces phenotypic heterogeneity, leading to either bacterial replication or the formation of nonreplicating persisters that could provide a reservoir for relapsing infection.},

abstract = {Several important pathogens cause disease by surviving and replicating within host cells. Bacterial proliferation is the product of both replication and killing undergone by the population. However, these processes are difficult to distinguish, and are usually assessed together by determination of net bacterial load. In addition, measurement of net load does not reveal heterogeneity within pathogen populations. This is particularly important in persistent infections in which slow or nongrowing bacteria are thought to have a major impact. Here we report the development of a reporter system based on fluorescence dilution that enables direct quantification of the replication dynamics of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) in murine macrophages at both the population and single-cell level. We used this technique to demonstrate that a major S. Typhimurium virulence determinant, the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 type III secretion system, is required for bacterial replication but does not have a major influence on resistance to killing. Furthermore, we found that, upon entry into macrophages, many bacteria do not replicate, but appear to enter a dormant-like state. These could represent an important reservoir of persistent bacteria. The approach could be extended to other pathogens to study the contribution of virulence and host resistance factors to replication and killing, and to identify and characterize nonreplicating bacteria associated with chronic or latent infections.},

@article{Hyrien2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, flow cytometric CFSE-labeling experiments have gained considerable popularity among experimentalists, especially immunologists and hematologists, for studying the processes of cell proliferation and cell death. Several mathematical models have been presented in the literature to describe cell kinetics during these experiments. RESULTS: We propose a multi-type age-dependent branching process to model the temporal development of populations of cells subject to division and death during CFSE-labeling experiments. We discuss practical implementation of the proposed model; we investigate a competing risk version of the process; and we identify the classes of cellular dependencies that may influence the expectation of the process and those that do not. An application is presented where we study the proliferation of human CD8+ T lymphocytes using our model and a competing risk branching process. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model offers a widely applicable approach to the analysis of CFSE-labeling experiments. The model fitted very well our experimental data. It provided reasonable estimates of cell kinetics parameters as well as meaningful insights into the processes of cell division and cell death. In contrast, the competing risk branching process could not describe the kinetics of CD8+ T cells. This suggested that the decision of cell division or cell death may be made early in the cell cycle if not in preceding generations. Also, we show that analyses based on the proposed model are robust with respect to cross-sectional dependencies and to dependencies between fates of linearly filiated cells.

abstract = {Techniques currently available for determining cell division are able to show one or, at best, a limited number of cell divisions. Other methods exist which can quantify overall division, but tell nothing about the division history of individual cells. Here we present a new technique is which an intracellular fluorescent label is divided equally between daughter cells upon cell division. The technique is applicable to in vitro cell division, as well as in vivo division of adoptively transferred cells, and can resolve multiple successive generations using flow cytometry. The label is fluorescein derived, allowing monoclonal antibodies conjugated to phycoerythrin or other compatible fluorochromes to be used to immunophenotype the dividing cells. © 1994.},

@article{Roostalu2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: A fundamental characteristic of cells is the ability to divide. To date, most parameters of bacterial cultures, including cell division, have been measured as cell population averages, assuming that all bacteria divide at a uniform rate.

RESULTS: We monitored the division of individual cells in Escherichia coli cultures during different growth phases. Our experiments are based on the dilution of green fluorescent protein (GFP) upon cell division, monitored by flow cytometry. The results show that the vast majority of E. coli cells in exponentially growing cultures divided uniformly. In cultures that had been in stationary phase up to four days, no cell division was observed. However, upon dilution of stationary phase culture into fresh medium, two subpopulations of cells emerged: one that started dividing and another that did not. These populations were detectable by GFP dilution and displayed different side scatter parameters in flow cytometry. Further analysis showed that bacteria in the non-growing subpopulation were not dead, neither was the difference in growth capacity reducible to differences in stationary phase-specific gene expression since we observed uniform expression of several stress-related promoters. The presence of non-growing persisters, temporarily dormant bacteria that are tolerant to antibiotics, has previously been described within growing bacterial populations. Using the GFP dilution method combined with cell sorting, we showed that ampicillin lyses growing bacteria while non-growing bacteria retain viability and that some of them restart growth after the ampicillin is removed. Thus, our method enables persisters to be monitored even in liquid cultures of wild type strains in which persister formation has low frequency.

CONCLUSION: In principle, the approaches developed here could be used to detect differences in cell division in response to different environmental conditions and in cultures of unicellular organisms other than E. coli.},
